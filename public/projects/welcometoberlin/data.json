Then we added some interaction with javascript (for example the hamburger menu). Finally we used a setTimeout to show the alert after one sec. That was really nice to get into this project, and sees, day after day, how complex the website became. Now I feel that it's quite simple, but that was a project I learnt a lot of things with !",
